Bitframes is an open source codec for generative art, contained within 32 bytes of data. Each stream of 32 bytes represents a single composition, that can be realized as a digital or print artwork. This repository contains the technical details and codec specification, but more details about the release of the artwork, and how it is being used to help crowdfund a documentary film about the history of Generative Art, can be found on the Bitframes website (will be released shortly).

## Codec

The codec for the artwork is described in [./docs/codec.md](./docs/codec.md).

## Crowdfund

Bitframes is being released as a month-long public crowdfund ('open edition ERC721 mint') on Ethereum L1, with 100% of all net proceeds from minting being directed toward the development of a feature-length documentary film on the history of Generative Art, being directed by Tordoff Films Ltd in the UK.

Website and details to be announced shortly.
